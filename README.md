## ðŸ“Œ Description
This application allows users to enter basic health and demographic information and get an estimated insurance premium.  
The prediction is powered by a pre-trained ML model deployed alongside the backend API.  
MongoDB stores user data and request logs, while React provides a responsive frontend interface.

## âš™ How It Works
1. **User Input:** The user fills out a form with age, gender, BMI, number of children, smoking status, and region.
2. **API Request:** The frontend sends this data via a POST request to the Express.js backend.
3. **Prediction:** The backend loads a trained ML model (`model.pkl`) and uses the input to predict the insurance charge.
4. **Response:** The API sends the prediction back to the frontend.
5. **Display:** The frontend shows the result instantly to the user.
